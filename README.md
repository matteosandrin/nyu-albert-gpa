# NYU Albert GPA Calculator

Have you opened the spanking-new NYU Albert interface?  
Have you noticed that there is *no* way to view your GPA except for ordering a transcript?  
Fear no more! This Chrome extension adds a nifty table in the "Grades" section of NYU Albert showing all the calculations that led to your GPA.

*If they did it would be pretty tasty dough.*

### Installing

There is currently no way to distribute packed Chrome extensions outside of the Chrome Web Store, so you'll have to load it as an unpacked extension. Unfortunately this means that for the time being this extension is only compatible with macOS and Linux, not Windows.  
I'm working on releasing this extension on the Chrome Web Store for everyone to use. I the meantime however, use the following procedure:

1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/matteosandrin/nyu-albert-gpa.git`
2. Navigate to the extensions panel on Chrome by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar
3. Check the `Developer mode` checkbox
4. Click on `Load unpacked extension...` and select the `unpacked` folder inside the repository
5. Enjoy!
